<br>

<p>
Utilized the Ultralytics framework for object detection in images and videos, enabling precise and efficient tracking of dynamic elements, including tennis players and the ball, to support advanced analysis and real-time performance monitoring.

Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to extract key points from tennis court imagery. This approach enabled the generation of a detailed court map via OpenCV, while also facilitating the analysis of player and ball velocities by leveraging the spatial data extracted from the imagery.
